    "- Data snooping (or data dredging) refers to the misuse of data analysis to find patterns in data that can be presented as statistically significant when in reality they may be due to chance. This often happens when a dataset is excessively mined to find any correlation without a predefined hypothesis, leading to results that are likely to be spurious."
